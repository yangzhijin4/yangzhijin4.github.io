<p>Man’s dearest possession is life. It is given to him but once, and he must live it so as to feel no torturing regrets for wasted years, never know the burning shame of a mean and petty past.<br>-Nikolai Ostrovsky</p>

<p>Sometimes I am upset that I can’t always be as good as I think. Then I will remember the above sentence, though it sounds radical, which encourages me to calm down and enjoy my current success. I am always a diligent girl and try my best to do everything. I paid for almost all my holidays to do something more meaningful. Even if I’m not lucky, I still feel good, because I did not waste my life. Zhijin, fighting!<br></p>

<h2 id="Project-Experience"><a href="#Project-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Project Experience"></a>Project Experience</h2><p>The following are some of my project experiences, although these are nothing compared to some outstanding seniors. But these experiences taught me a lot. I have strong mobility and execution.</p>

<ul>
<li>Supervised by Dr. Haichuan Ren </li>
<li>We are constructing a hardware and software system, our robot is designed to reducing the risk of amputation due to muscle atrophy of the lower limbs during the patients’ fainting. And in the software section, providing a friendly interface for doctors.</li>
<li>I work with electric and mechanical teammates to design the conduct plan and my main job is to visualize the status of patients to doctors and the communication between upper computer and microcontroller.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project is in progress, I will follow up the progress of the project, and the following are some achievements of our laboratory.</p>

<ul>
<li>Supervised by Dr. Yangjie Cao and Dr. Cong Yang </li>
<li>We employ physical layer Channel State Information(CSI) as the indicator of activities. Using a multiple transmitter-receiver link to achieve omnidirectional personnel detection near the receiver, and the LSTM network structure to train the data set. </li>
<li>I contribute to set up the experimental environment, and preprocess and train data. </li>
</ul>
<p>It took us a lot of work to build the experimental environment. But the data is always the most important. The following picture shows the process of collecting data.</p>
<p><img src="/images/CSI.jpg" width="50%"></p>
<p>The following are the results obtained after training with LSTM.</p>

<ul>
<li>Supervised by Dr. Cong Yang </li>
<li>We are requied to predict the numbers of native speakers and total language speakers and the geographic distributions of these languages in the next 50 years. Then propose a best solution for the location of six overseas oﬃces of an international company.</li>
<li>My main task is to build models and help complete the paper.(We have three people, one modeling, one programming, one writing)</li>
</ul>
<p>I am very grateful to my teammates, XiaoChong Jiang and Yaqi Feng, for bringing with me for this intense four days(we just sleep 10 hours totally). We three people encourage each other when we encounter difficulties. That’s why we can finish. We have all become the best iron buddies for each other since then.<br>Of course, our instructor, Cong Yang, is the best teacher I know. He really gave us three great guides. I am very touched, on the last night, professor Cong Yang helps us modify the paper overnight.<br>here is our <a href="88596.pdf">paper</a> and <a href="MCM.pdf">award certificate</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Supervised by Dr. Yangjie Cao </li>
<li>We build a hardware and software system, the design of the robot inspired by the inchworm. we construct a two-legged multi-joint robot with three gaits(twist, reverse and inchworm gait). And there is a cloud platform to receive the collected data in real time. </li>
<li>I participate in robot assembly and control, the communication between the upper computer and the cloud platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>We designed two robots and applied for China’s invention patents, pantent nos: 201710388616.4 and 201810138547.6.</p>

<p>The design details of the mechanical claw part are shown in the following figure(I draw them). The method shown in the figure adopts some new plastic materials, which can increase the friction of the underlying surface.</p>
<p><img src="/images/claw1.jpg" width="40%"><img src="/images/claw2.jpg" width="40%"></p>
<p>Here are three types of gait(twist, reverse and inchworm gait) for the two-legged multi-joint robot.You can watch video,<a href="twist.mp4">twist</a>,<a href="reverse.mp4">reverse</a> and <a href="inchworm.mp4">inchworm</a> gait(these videos are large, please make sure you are in wifi).</p>
