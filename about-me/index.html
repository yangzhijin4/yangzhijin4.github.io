<p>The above sentence comes from The Road Not Taken, which is my favorite.<br></p>
<p><img src="/images/me.jpg" wid="100%"></p>
<p>I come from Luoyang, China. If you love history, you will be familiar with my hometown. The only female emperor in China, Wu Zetian, established the capital here.<br><br>I love painting. Although computer graphics are very powerful nowadays, I am also very proud that my painting skills can quickly help me to visualize it when I need to express my thoughts in my mind. It sounds cart before the horse, but this skill really helps to me. I am very grateful to my mother for inheriting my good artistic genes. My mother is a descendant of the great poet Bai Juyi. She is now an art teacher. Here is my personal seal(杨知锦印):<br></p>
<p><img src="/images/yinzhang.gif" width="10%"></p>
<h2 id="Advantages"><a href="#Advantages" class="headerlink" title="Advantages"></a>Advantages</h2><ul>
<li><p>I’m a excellent leader. <br><font color="gray">From my sophomore year, I started as the team leader because I was the only girl in the team. I must do some extra work, but I also have some unexpected gains such as the ability to express and teamwork. The most important thing is that I realized that the team’s cohesion is precious, which determines the efficiency of the work and the final result.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p>I have strong academic skills. <br><font color="gray">As an undergraduate I didn’t have the opportunity to delve into some techniques more deeply, but I developed good scientific research habits from past research experiences. I believe that these qualities will make me easier to my future research career.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p>I’m a peerless girl. <br><font color="gray">Although there are more boys here, some people think that boys are always better than girls. I don’t think this is no sense. For example, in the modeling contest, we only have four days to complete all the work. I think the girl’s thinking mode can sometimes help us solve problems better, and my physical strength is not worse than that of boys (I didn’t even sleep for one minute in the last two days).</font></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Disadvantages"><a href="#Disadvantages" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages"></a>Disadvantages</h2><ul>
<li>I don’t have a high GPA(about 3.3/4.0). <br><font color="gray">My freshman year was the most confusing period for me. I joined the lab and the student union at the same time. Obviously, I was busy on both sides, so my grades were not very good this year. However, I chose to stay in the lab after the end of the student union duty. I know that the past can’t be changed, but it is worth mentioning that my grades have been on the rise. </font></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Goal-amp-Ambition"><a href="#Goal-amp-Ambition" class="headerlink" title="Goal &amp; Ambition"></a>Goal &amp; Ambition</h2><ul>
<li><p>Becoming a talent person in my major. <br><font color="gray">My plan for the next five years is to continue reading until I get my PhD. </font></p>
</li>
<li><p>Establishing my own company in the future.<br><font color="gray">I hope to accumulate some money and contacts before I get to 40, and then start my own business.</font></p>
</li>
</ul>
